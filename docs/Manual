Running CCNX-Trace
------------------

o In a collection of ccn nodes, all the machines should run the trace_server. The client expresses 
interest for /trace/<namespace>. The trace_server asks local ccnd to forward all 
trace interests to it so that it can handle them properly. Therefore if any node is  
not running the trace_server, local ccnd will drop the packet.

o At the client machine, both trace_server and trace_client has to be run. Without the server,
the client would timeout.


Configuring a testbed for ccnx-trace
-------------------------------------

o Run trace_server on each node. This program does not require any argument. This can be
also run in the background.

    $ trace_server &

o At the client, run the trace_client. It takes two arguments, -u for the URI to trace to and
-t for timeout. The usage can be seen using

    $ trace_client -h 


o Note that ccnx has a default timeout value of 4 secs for an interest packet.
So if the -t value is 12 secs and the client is nor receiving any answer, the client would retry 
three times before giving up.

o Make sure you have a route to the content you are trying to trace to. For example, for tracing to
/ndn/csu/netsec/index, you should have a FIB entry that points to /ndn/csu/netsec/index
