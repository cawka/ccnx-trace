Running CCNX-Trace
------------------

o In a collection of ccn nodes, all the machines should run the ccn_traced. The client expresses 
interest for /trace/<namespace>. The ccn_traced asks local ccnd to forward all 
trace interests to it so that it can handle them properly. Therefore if any node is  
not running the ccn_traced, local ccnd will drop the packet.

o At the client machine, both ccn_traced and trace has to be run. Without the server,
the client would timeout.


Configuring a testbed for ccnx-trace
-------------------------------------

o Run ccn_traced on each node. This program does not require any argument. This can be
also run in the background.

    $ ccn_traced &

o At the client, run the trace. It takes two arguments, -u for the URI to trace to and
-t for timeout. The usage can be seen using

    $ trace -h 


o Note that ccnx has a default timeout value of 4 secs for an interest packet.
So if the -t value is 12 secs and the client is nor receiving any answer, the client would retry 
three times before giving up.

o Make sure you have a route to the content you are trying to trace to. For example, for tracing to
/ndn/csu/netsec/index, you should have a FIB entry that points to /ndn/csu/netsec/index


Output
------

The left hand side number of the hop count. The right hand side shows the id of
the node. Note that currently this is IP address, but can be replaced by any
unique ID.


The output means the following:

o 192.168.1.1:LOCAL
    * The content is locally published at 192.168.1.1

o 0: 192.168.1.1 
  1: TIMEOUT TO 192.168.1.2
    * Timeout between 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2

o 192.168.1.1: NO SUCH CONTENT
    * The namespace is ok and the interest got routed properly. However, the node
    does not publish any such content

o 192.168.1.1: NO ROUTE
    * 192.168.1.1 does not know how to forward the interest.

o Did not receive any reply
    * The client did not receive any reply from local server. Check if local trace
    server is running.
    * Or the network is taking more time than a single timeout to respond. Try 
    increasing the timeout.
